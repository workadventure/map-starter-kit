# WorkAdventure Map Starter Kit

![map](./map.png)

This is a starter kit to help you build your own map for [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).

To understand how to use this starter kit, follow the tutorial at [https://workadventu.re/map-building](https://workadventu.re/map-building).

## Structure
* *public*: Static files like PDFs or audio files
* *src*: Scripts files
* *tilesets*: All tilesets
* *map.tmj*: Map file
* *map.png*: The map thumbnail displayed on the in-game map information

If you want to use more than one map file, just add the new map file on root or in a folder.

we recommend using 500x500 images for the map thumbnails.

If you are going to create custom websites to embed in the map, please reference the HTML files in the `input` option in *vite.config.js*.
